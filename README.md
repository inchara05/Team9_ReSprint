# Team9 ReSprint
Agile Project 
CS555 

The aim of this game is to earn points by pumping up virtual balloons. The balloon will inflate
and you will earn points for each pump. If the balloon gets too big it will pop and all the
secured points from that balloon will be lost! You can save the points from a balloon before
its pops.
Now, one may think that this is as simple as It seems to be. But, to be frank itâ€™s really not.
So, here is how one may not pass through luck.
There will be a hidden sequence or pattern as to how the balloon will pop.
A brainy player will have to understand, the sequence or pattern behind it and has to score
throughout the sequence. If the game prolongs and reaches the time limit mentioned the
sequence or pattern will automatically change with every game. Also, each level will have a
leader board.

How will this game improve our mental health?

Since this game is sequential-based it makes one, think more than normal. This improves
mathematical thinking and it helps reduce stress and gives relaxation to the mind.

## Internal Details
